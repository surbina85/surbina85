## 👨🏽‍💻👋🏽 About me

<div align="justify">

Hi! I'm Sergio, a seasoned professional on a journey of reinvention. 

For over 15 years, I've had the privilege of working across various industries and countries—from Nicaragua to Chile, the UK, and Ireland— in roles such as Technical Project Management and Onboarding/Implementation Consultant. My career has revolved around delivering technology, solving problems, bridging technical and business needs, and leading teams to success.

But life took a turn when the company I worked for, The Chat Shop, closed its doors. While challenging, it also gave me something rare: the opportunity to pause and reflect on my next steps. I decided to *pivot* back to a passion I’ve carried for years but for various reasons I always left on the side—data, statistics, and optimising just about everything. 

This path led me to dive headfirst into data analysis, refining my skills in Excel and SQL, mastering new tools like Tableau and Python, and more. My ultimate goal? To blend my years of strategic and operational expertise with the power of data-driven decision-making.

When I’m not knee-deep in data and visualizations, you’ll probably find me outdoors—hiking or running—, watching some football (soccer), or exploring ways to make life just a little more efficient (and enjoyable).

Take a look around to see how my experience, skills, and curiosity can help you solve your challenges. Let’s connect—I’m always up for a chat with others with similar interests or goals.
